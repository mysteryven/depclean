# DepClean

A Rust port of [depcheck](https://github.com/depcheck/depcheck). Currently, it only supports analyze ESM and require statement in your JS family files(js, jsx, mjs, cjs, ts, tsx), my goal is to port the original depcheck.

[depCheck](https://github.com/depcheck/depcheck) is a really awesome tool, you definitely should check it out first!
