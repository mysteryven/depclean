<h1 align="center">ðŸ§¼ DepClean</h1>

A Rust version of [depcheck]. It supports analyze ESM and require statement in your JS family files currently.

```js
["js", "mjs", "cjs", "jsx", "ts", "mts", "cts", "tsx"]
```

[depcheck] is a really awesome tool, you definitely should check it out first!

This project is developed out of personal interest and currently in the prototype stage. 

I want to
 improve my Rust skill by investigating the feasibility of using [oxc]. If more people like it, I will continue to develop and enhance it, ideally to be a drop-in replacement for [depcheck]!
